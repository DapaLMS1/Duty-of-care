ðŸ“š Duty of Care Legal Flashcards for Australian Dental Assistants
This repository contains an interactive learning module designed specifically for Australian dental assistants to master the fundamental legal obligation of Duty of Care. The resource uses responsive flip cards to aid in memorization and quick recall of key concepts.
